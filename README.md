Dotfiles!!!
===========

All the configuration file that have made my life much easier. Mostly used in configurating bash and vim.

Most of my work in vim is python (and jinja) with javascript, but I tried to build it to be as language-agnostic as I could.

To install, put this in your home directory and run install.sh.

**WARNING**: running install.sh will *overwrite your user's crontab*.

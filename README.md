Dotfiles!!!
===========

All the configuration file that have made my life much easier. Mostly used in configurating bash and vim. I use this repository to sync my configurations among multiple machines. I also store some configuration files in the conf directory as backup.

Most of my work is python (with jinja) and javascript, but I tried to build everything as language-, OS-, and version-agnostic as I could... as long as you're on mac or linux :)

I cobbled most of these together from browsing other people's dotfiles repositories on Github. Thanks, everyone!

To install, put this in your home directory and run install.sh.

**WARNING**: running install.sh will *overwrite your user's crontab and other configuration files*. You should pretty much only run this script if you are me.

Dotfiles!!!
===========

All the configuration file that have made my life much easier. Mostly used in configurating bash and vim. I use this repository to sync my configurations among multiple machines.

Most of my work is python (with jinja) and javascript, but I tried to build everything as language-agnostic as I could. These files are also OS-agnostic as long as you're on mac or linux. :)

To install, put this in your home directory and run install.sh.

**WARNING**: running install.sh will *overwrite your user's crontab*.
